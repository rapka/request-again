# request-again

Install via npm:

    npm install --save request-again

## What Does it Do?

This module is a plugin for [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request), not a direct replacement. For now, it only supports a limited portion of request's functionality.

The request-again module allows you to cache the body of a request http call for a period of time. This is helpful if you regularly call an external API, but the information you are retrieving is updated infrequently.

## How to Use It

After installing the module:

    var request = require('request-again');

Then call ``request.cached()`` like you would call request ordinarily. Here's an example calling the Pok√©mon API:

    request.cached('http://pokeapi.co/api/v1/pokemon/1', {
      someOption: value
    }, function(err, res, body) {
      return console.log('The request took:',
        Date.now() - startTime + ' ms');
    });

If you make the same request call within a period of time, you will retrieve the cached object immediately instead of calling the API again.

## Defaults and Settings

A cache will be created automatically when you require the module with the following default settings:

* ``max: 10``. This is the maximum size (number of objects) held by the cache. If the maximum is exceeded, the least-recently-used object will be kicked from the cache.
* ``maxAge: 60000``. This is the maximum time (in milliseconds) which an object will be stored in the cache before new data is requested from the external API. The default is 1 minute.

You can override the default settings:

    request.enableCache({
      max: 50,
      maxAge: 20000
    });

## How It Works

The cache is set based on the ``url`` of the request as well as the ``options`` object. Future request calls must match both of these parameters for the cache to be retrieved, otherwise a new http call will be made and that new response will be stored in the cache.

## Future Development

Right now the module only supports a request structure of:

    request.cached(url, optionsObject, callbackFunction);

So it is not quite as flexible as a standard request object. Additionally, if you retrieve a cached response, the first two parameters of the callback function (``error`` and ``response``) will be ``null``, so you will only get back the ``body``.

We plan to make this more flexible and full-featured in the feature.

## Version History

* 0.0.4 Initial release. This will need some serious work before I consider it production ready.
